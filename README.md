# Object-Recognition-using-deep-learning-and-satellite-imagery
This project is implemented in python (OpenCv) and developed using deep convolutional neural networks and various algorithms for detecting objects. For recognizing satellite images in real time the data is collected for national aerospace laboratories which will recognize and detect the objects.
